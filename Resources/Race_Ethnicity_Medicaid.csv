Notes,,,,,,,,
The American Community Survey did not release the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to data collection brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Data may not sum to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Data include the civilian noninstitutionalized population in the United States.,,,,,,,,
