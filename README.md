### Project-Three

### The objective of this assignment is to visually depict variations in Health Coverage across the United States. These variations will be analyzed based on factors such as age, sex, race, etc., in relation to the origin of coverage. We hope that this research will provide insights into any existing weaknesses in Healthcare Coverage, fostering a better understanding of the current landscape.
